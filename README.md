# Results Summary Component
This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Process
- Like in the previous challenges, I built this component with Next.js and styled-components.
- I used a local JSON file to dynamically generate the scores with their corresponding icons and colors.
- Instead of generating the background colors manually, I decided to convert the RGB colors to RGBA with a custom opacity value and assign them through props. This wouldn't be possible without styled-components.

## ðŸ”§ Built With
- Next.Js
- Styled-components
- React
- Git
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
